# Semiconductor DataMatrix Prediction and Reconstruction

This project focuses on reconstructing and detecting Data Matrix codes 
engraved on semiconductor surfaces. It involves preprocessing distorted 
images using image processing techniques and training a custom object detection model 
using Roboflow for automated detection.

---

## Overview

Many semiconductor images contain degraded or visually corrupted DataMatrix (DM) codes. 
These codes are reconstructed using classical image processing techniques. 
Once reconstructed, a YOLO model was trained to perform robust detection on a diverse 
set of noisy, colored, and blurred DM samples.

## How to Use

### ðŸ”§ Reconstructing DM Images

Use the `revertImages.py` script to process a directory of distorted DM images based on one of the four known distortion patterns.

```bash
python revertImages.py "D:\Path-to-Image-Directory" "pattern-name"
```

## YOLO Object Detection
The YOLOv8 object detection model was trained using images reconstructed by this project.

You can view and test the model on Roboflow:

ðŸ‘‰ [View Project on Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/dmdetection-ar4dk/dm-detection/models)

The model was trained with noise-augmented and varied-quality images to improve detection
robustness.

## Below are the processing and detection results.

These images reflect the results after applying image processing techniques and 
YOLO-based object detection.

### Notes:
- Replace the `Roboflow` link if you want the exact model/project page.
- Make sure images exist at those paths. If structure changes, update paths accordingly.
- You can add a `.gif` or small screen recording to show reconstruction if needed.

Would you like me to generate a preview `.md` file or help auto-format the image grid better?
